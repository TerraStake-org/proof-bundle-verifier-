Verify your cryptographic results offline.

**Proves:** Data hasn't been tampered with (content-addressed)

"‚ö†Ô∏è This is a working demo of our Bitcoin-anchored VRF system. 
The UI and cloudfare connection is basic because we're focused on the cryptography. 
The verification is production-ready."
Test it, verify.

##  Why This Is Cryptographically Sound.

**1. VRF (Verifiable Random Function)**
-  **Provably random** - Cannot be manipulated
-  **Deterministic** - Same input always gives same output
-  **Verifiable** - Anyone can check the proof

**2. Bitcoin UTXO Anchoring**
-  **Immutable** - Blockchain data can't be changed
-  **Timestamped** - Proves when traits were generated
-  **Historic significance** - Legendary Bitcoin transactions add value

**3. Merkle Trees**
-  **Efficient** - Verify without downloading full dataset
-  **Tamper-proof** - Any change invalidates root
-  **Fixed pool** - UTXOs are predetermined and public

**4. Ed25519 Signatures**
-  **Authenticity** - Proves origin
-  **Non-repudiation** - Cannot deny issuance
-  **Fast verification** - Browser-friendly

---This is better than most NFT projects. Most just use Math.random() üòÇ
Our system is cryptographically provable, blockchain-anchored, and publicly verifiable.
